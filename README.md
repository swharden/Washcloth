**Washcloth is a .NET Standard library for reading XML code comments from inside running applications.** Comments in source code are used to display tooltip information in Visual Studio and can be automatically saved in XML files, but this documentation is not added into program assemblies so it is not available in compiled applications. Washcloth bridges this gap by reading the XML documentation file and combining its comments with program information found at runtime using reflection.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Washcloth is early in development.** It is currently [major version zero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4) and the public API should not be considered stable.

## Quickstart

### Add XML Comments to Code
```cs
public class MathClass
{
    /// <summary>Calculate area of a circle</summary>
    /// <param name="r">radius</param>
    /// <returns>area in original units squared</returns>
    public double CircleArea(double r = 123) => Math.PI * r * r;
}
```

### Generate XML Documentation

Edit your csproj file to include the following:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
</PropertyGroup>
```

üí° Define `GenerateDocumentationFile` instead of `DocumentationFile` to ensure the XML filename always matches the assembly name.

### Read XML Documentation using C#

```cs
MethodInfo info = typeof(MathClass).GetMethod("CircleArea");
XElement xml = Washcloth.XmlDoc.GetMember(info);
Console.WriteLine(xml);
```


```
<member name="M:Washcloth_Testing.MathClass.CircleArea(System.Double)">
  <summary>Calculate area of a circle</summary>
  <param name="r">radius</param>
  <returns>area in original units squared</returns>
</member>
```

### Determine Signatures using C#

```cs
MethodInfo info = typeof(MathClass).GetMethod("CircleArea");
string signature = Washcloth.XmlDoc.GetSignature(info);
Console.WriteLine(signature);
```

```
public double CircleArea(double radius = 123)
```

## History

Washcloth is derived from [Towel](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel) by [Zachary Patten](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten), a .NET library intended to add core functionality and make advanced topics as clean and simple as possible. Towel has tools for working with data structures, algorithms, mathematics, metadata, extensions, console, and more. Towel favors newer coding practices over maintaining backwards compatibility, and at the time of writing Towel only supports .NET 5 and newer.

Washcloth was born from the desire to use Towel's metadata tools for reflection and XML documentation in legacy environments like .NET Framework. [Scott Harden](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten) isolated Towel's metadata tools and refactored the library to target .NET Standard 2.0, allowing it to be used in projects back to .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1. This new project was named Washcloth, because a washcloth is really just a small towel with less functionality.
